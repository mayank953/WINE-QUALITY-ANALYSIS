<h1>WINE QUALITY ANALYSIS</h1>


<p>An Entry level project in Data Science on Wine dataset. In this project, I have tried to apply my basic understanding of data science concept so as to build a quality classifier.&nbsp;<br /><br />The complete report of the project is available&nbsp;in PROJECT REPORT.pdf</p>

<p>The whole project has been carried out in R &amp; the appropriate codes have been provided.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here we have to rate the wine based on its characteristic.<br />I have added the comments on the code so as to make it easy to understand at every point.&nbsp;</p>
